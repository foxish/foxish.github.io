						This was a talk given by <a href="https://labs.yahoo.com/researchers/shamma" target="_blank">David Ayman Shamma</a>, 
						currently a director of research at Yahoo! Labs and Flickr where he heads the Human-Computer Interaction Research group.
						He gave <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/research/seminars/abstracts/csce-681/2015-2016#shamma" target="_blank">this talk</a> 
						at Texas A&M University on Feb 1 2016. 
						It covered several aspects of system design, 
						software engineering, and AI using examples of problems solved by the HCI research
						division at Yahoo! Labs.
					</p>

					  <h3>Part 1:  Human-in-the-loop AI systems</h3>
					  In the first part of the talk, Dr. Shamma covered a problem they 
					  solved at Flickr in relation with Yahoo weather. The Yahoo 
					  weather application for iOS and Android is a modern smartphone weather
					  application.
					  
					  <img src="../images/yahoo_weather.jpg" alt="yahoo weather" class="image left"/>
					  The application as one can see, presents the user with beautiful 
					  images of their current region. Dr. Shamma went on to describe the process used 
					  to find images matching the region and current weather conditions. It was
					  a manual process of curation with editors going through each image. The process 
					  of discovery of new images to review was manual and involved 
					  looking through "favoriting" interactions of connected people to find
					  more images of a certain kind. The ingest pool of the editors was, at the 
					  time, around 47,000 images requiring review. 
					</p>
					  <br class="clear" />
					<p>
					  The images editors chose had
					  to meet requirements, such as:
					  <ul class="default">
					  	<li>Clarity</li>
					  	<li>Size</li>
					  	<li>No pedestrians/faces</li>
					  	<li>No borders</li>
					  	<li>No watermarks</li>
					  </ul>
						Clearly, a much better system could be envisioned to help aggregate images 
						for the editors.
						The research team first developed a system of discovery by using a mechanism
						similar to that used by the editors themselves, relying on the observation that
						good photographers were likely to view and engage with other good photographers 
						who were interested in similar subjects. This led to them forming a 
						social graph with photographers having common interests in
						photography, such as lightning photography, forming cliques. This was done using
						a Markov Network using viewing data for the users. The ingest pool for editors was
						now 6.1M photographs, which was several times larger than before. Furthermore, 
						they used Artifical Neural Networks with feedback from the editors' behavior 
						to learn to identify and reject photographs which were unacceptable in some way. 
						This trimmed the ingest pool down to a far more manageable 0.9M photographs. 
						The Markov Network itself was seen to reduce the number of photographs with 
						watermarks and borders, as users tended to favor such images less.
					</p>
					<p>
						The effect of this process was that under the new system, the photographs had an
						acceptance rate of 30% (which is high considering two stages of review). 
						This above approach to not simply supplanting human editors, but aiding them
						with AI systems using their input to get better and train software to help 
						humans become more effective at their job proved successful. 
						The productivity of editors was significantly increased with this process
						improvement.

					  <h3>Part 2:  Study of photographs en masse</h3>
					  One of the interesting parts of this talk was Dr. Shamma's description of 
					  research they conducted on how filters, especially those that 
					  modern photo sharing applications like Instagram and Flickr apply, affect 
					  user engagement with the photographs. The 
					  <a href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm15.why.bakhshi.pdf" target="_blank">
					  full paper</a> goes into the details. The primary technique they employed for
					  this study was negative binomial regression. They studied the 7.6 million Flickr
					  photographs set, and drew some very interesting conclusions. The metrics they studied
					  under the aforementioned model were engagement, measured in terms of views
					  and commenting activities on photographs. They observed that filtered photos were 21 percent 
					  more likely to be viewed and 45 percent more likely to be commented on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, they analyzed the types of photographs which were most impacted by the 
						use of filters. First, they used Amazon Mechanical Turk to categorize photographs
						under a variety of different categories, such as 'Nature', 'People', 'Things' and so on.
						They found that nature photographs showed a drop in engagement upon the application of filters
						, pictures of people showed mixed results, and photographs of 'things' showed a 
						positive impact on engagement when filters were applied.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3>Part 3: Challenging Problems</h3>
						Several of the challenges faced in dealing with photographs at scale were
						also described in detail. Geo-location and chronological information 
						found associated with photographs is often inaccurate. Mapping software
						additionally tends to ignore that regions tend to change name over 
						long periods of time. There is a need for versioning with place names
						but the simplistic systems of today tend to ignore this sometimes. Due to these
						issues, the study of photographs using simply their metadata has only limited
						success and unifying standards and better practices need to be ensured for 
						the future of digital storage.
