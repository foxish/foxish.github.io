    I'm Anirudh, a graduate student in the Computer Science department 
    at Texas A&M University, and this is my course webpage for 
    <a href="http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~shipman/courses/cnm/2015/home.html" 
    target="_blank">CSCE-656: Computers and New Media</a>. My interests lie in 
    distributed systems and programming languages. I work with 
    <a href="https://parasol.tamu.edu/~jarvi/" target="_blank">Dr. Jaakko JÃ¤rvi</a> 
    on on formalizing and standardizing user interface programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes I <a href="http://twitter.com/anirudh4444" target="_blank">tweet</a> about things that I find interesting. 
    I hand-coded most of this website with <a href="http://www.smartmenus.org/" target="_blank">SmartMenus</a> and 
    some CSS tricks from <a href="http://codepen.io/bennettfeely/pen/Ftczh" target="_blank">
      Bennett Feely's codepen</a>. 
    My primary webpage is <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~anirudh4444" target="_blank">here</a>.

  <div class="cardheader"><strong>Motivation</strong></div>
  <p>
    My motivation for taking up this course is the desire to study the evolution 
    of media through history and the role it has played in shaping human lives. 
    I believe this is key to understanding the ways in which new media 
    changes the way we think. An understanding of new media can help in building 
    new ways to present ideas and knowledge effectively, leading to faster 
    growth & innovation.
