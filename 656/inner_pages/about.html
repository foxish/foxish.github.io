    I'm Anirudh Ramanathan, a graduate student in the Computer Science department 
    at Texas A&M University, and this is my course webpage for 
    <a href="http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~shipman/courses/cnm/2015/home.html" 
    target="_blank">CSCE-656: Computers and New Media</a>. 
    I work with <a href="https://parasol.tamu.edu/~jarvi/" target="_blank">Dr. Jaakko JÃ¤rvi</a> on on formalizing and standardizing user 
    interface programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    My motivation for taking up the course is my desire to study the evolution of media through history 
    and the role it has played in our lives. I believe this is key to understanding new ways
    in which media can influence the future, and in building new forms to present 
    ideas and knowledge in effective ways, leading to faster innovation.
