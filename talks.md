### Spark+AI Summit 2018
Date: June 05, 2018 <br/>
Speaker Page: <a href="https://databricks.com/speaker/anirudh-ramanathan" target="_blank">link</a><br/>

The Kubernetes and Spark communities have put their heads together over the past year to come up with a new native scheduler for Kubernetes within Apache Spark.In this talk, we explore the exciting new things that this native Kubernetes integration makes possible with Apache Spark. We also go over the roadmap and features that the Kubernetes community has planned for the scheduler over the next several releases of Spark.

### Couchbase Silicon Valley Meetup
Date: April 19, 2018 <br/>
Session Page: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Couchbase-Silicon-Valley/events/246877009/" target="_blank">link</a>

Provide an overview of GKE. We’ll do a walk-through how to deploy a Couchbase cluster in GKE with Couchbase Operator. We’ll also demonstrate scaling and simulate failure scenarios to show how the operator reacts under stress, simplifying administration and operations for the user.

### SF Kubernetes Meetup: Machine Learning and AI with Kuberentes
Date: December 13, 2017 <br/>
Session Page: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Kubernetes-Meetup/events/244670221/" target="_blank">link</a>

Kubernetes as an application deployment platform can help set up and deploy machine learning applications, all the way from training to production. This talk describes the newly evolving ML stack built entirely on Kubernetes. It also goes into details of how one can use a combination of different tools to create a portable and powerful ML stack.

Speaker Page: <a href="http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/global-software-architecture-conference-86/speaker-details/anirudh-ramanathan-51737.html" target="_blank">link</a><br/>

Stateful applications like databases, file systems and message queues, to data
processing frameworks like Spark are being increasingly run on Kubernetes. This
talk will focus on some Kubernetes features and constructs being worked on by
the open source community to support all these classes of workloads.

### Spark Summit 2017

I (re)founded the SIG in Jan 2017 and incubated several projects such as Apache Spark, Apache Airflow
HDFS, etc. The community in SIG Big Data deals with best practices around
Big Data and ML applications in containers & Kubernetes.
